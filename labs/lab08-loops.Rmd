> ### Learning Objectives
>
> - Get familiar with the syntax of a `while` loop
> - Get familiar with the syntax of a `repeat` loop
> - Introduction to the R package "testthat"
> - Write simple functions and their unit tests
> - Test your code


### General Instructions

The purpose of this lab is two-fold: 

1) Keep practicing loops, and writing simple functions (you do NEED to submit Rmd and html files for this part).

2) Getting started with writing tests for
your functions (you don't need to submit any files for this part).

- Write your descriptions, explanations, and code in an `Rmd` (R markdown) file.
- Name this file as `lab08-first-last.Rmd`, where `first` and `last` are your
first and last names (e.g. `lab08-gaston-sanchez.Rmd`).
- Knit your `Rmd` file as an html document (default option).
- Submit your `Rmd` and `html` files to bCourses, in the corresponding lab assignment.
- Due date displayed in the syllabus (see github repo).

## Your Turn: Average

The average of $n$ numbers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ is given by the following 
formula:

![arithmetic mean](lab08-images/arith_mean.png)

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n}{n}
$$

Write R code, using each type of loop (e.g. `for`, `while`, `repeat`) to 
implement the arithmetic mean of the vector `x = 1:100`


## Your Turn: Standard Deviation

The sample standard deviation of a list of $n$ numbers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ 
is given by the following formula:

![standard deviation](lab08-images/std_dev.png)

$$
SD = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2 }
$$

Write R code, using each type of loop (e.g. `for`, `while`, `repeat`) to 
implement the sample standard deviation of the vector `x = 1:100`


## Your Turn: Geometric Mean

The geometric mean of $n$ numbers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ is given by the 
following formula:

![geometric mean](lab08-images/geom_mean.png)

$$
\bar{x} = \left ( \prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right )^{1/n}
$$

Write R code, using each type of loop (e.g. `for`, `while`, `repeat`) to 
implement the geometric mean of the vector `x = 1:50`

## Your Turn: Distance Matrix of Letters

The following code generates a random matrix `distances` with arbitrary 
distance values among letters in English:

```{r}
# random distance matrix
num_letters <- length(LETTERS)
set.seed(123)
values <- sample.int(num_letters) 
distances <- values %*% t(values)
diag(distances) <- 0
dimnames(distances) <- list(LETTERS, LETTERS)
```

The first 5 rows and columns of `distances` are:

```{r}
distances[1:5, 1:5]
```


Consider the following character vector `vec <- c('E', 'D', 'A')`. The idea is 
to use the values in matrix `distances` to compute the total distance between 
the letters: that is from `E` to `D`, and then from `D` to `A`:

```{r}
# (E to D) + (D to A)
483 + 168
```

Hence, you can say that the letters in the word `'E' 'D' 'A'` have a total distance value of `r 483 + 168`.


### Your Turn: 

Write a function `get_dist()` that takes two inputs: 

- `distances` = the matrix of distance among letters.
- `ltrs` = a character vector of upper case letters. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
get_dist <- function(dists, ltrs) {
  if (!all(ltrs %in% LETTERS)) {
    stop('Unrecognized character')
  }
  sum_dist <- 0
  for (l in 1:(length(ltrs)-1)) {
    from <- ltrs[l]
    to <- ltrs[l+1]
    sum_dist <- sum_dist + dists[from,to]
  }
  sum_dist
}
```

The function must return a numeric value with the total distance. Also, include
a stopping condition---via `stop()`---for when a value in `ltrs` does not match
any capital letter. The error message should be `"Unrecognized character"`

Here's an example of how you should be able to invoke `get_dist()`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
vec <- c('E', 'D', 'A')
get_dist(distances, vec)
```

And here's an example that should raise an error:

```{r eval = FALSE}
err <- c('E', 'D', ')')
get_dist(distances, err)
```


Test your function with the following character vectors:

- `cal <- c('C', 'A', 'L')`
- `stats <- c('S', 'T', 'A', 'T', 'S')`
- `oski <- c('O', 'S', 'K', 'I')`
- `zzz <- rep('Z', 3)`
- `lets <- LETTERS`
- a vector `first` with letters for your first name, e.g. `c('G', 'A', 'S', 'T', 'O', 'N')`
- a vector `last` for your last name, e.g. `c('S', 'A', 'N', 'C', 'H', 'E', 'Z')`

```{r echo = FALSE}
cal = c('C', 'A', 'L')
stats = c('S', 'T', 'A', 'T', 'S')
oski = c('O', 'S', 'K', 'I')
zzz = rep('Z', 3)
lets = LETTERS
first = c('G', 'A', 'S', 'T', 'O', 'N')
last = c('S', 'A', 'N', 'C', 'H', 'E', 'Z')
```


__Your turn:__ Assuming that you already created the objects listed above, 
now create an R list `strings` like this:

```{r}
# use your own 'first' and 'last' objects
strings <- list(
  cal = cal,
  stats = stats,
  oski = oski,
  zzz = zzz,
  lets = lets,
  first = first,
  last = last
)
```

Write a `for()` loop to iterate over the elements in `strings`, and compute
their distances. At each iteration, store the calculated distances in a list 
called `strings_dists`; this list should have the same names as `strings`.

How does your list `strings_dists` look like?

## R package `"testthat"`

`"testthat"` is one of the packages in R that helps you write tests for your functions. First, remember to install the package:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# do not include this code in your Rmd
# execute this in your console
install.packages("testthat")
```

- `"testthat"` provides a testing framework for R that is easy to learn and use
- `"testthat"` has a hierarchical structure made up of:
    + expectations
    + tests
    + contexts
- A __context__ involves __tests__ formed by groups of __expectations__
- Each structure has associated functions:
    + `expect_that()` for expectations
    + `test_that()` for groups of tests
    + `context()` for contexts

```{r eval = FALSE}
# load testthat
library(testthat)
```


### List of common expectation functions

| Function                  | Description                             |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `expect_true(x)`          | expects that `x` is `TRUE`              |
| `expect_false(x)`         | expects that `x` is `FALSE`             |
| `expect_null(x)`          | expects that `x` is `NULL`              |
| `expect_type(x)`          | expects that `x` is of type `y`         |
| `expect_is(x, y)`         | expects that `x` is of class `y`        |
| `expect_length(x, y)`     | expects that `x` is of length `y`       |
| `expect_equal(x, y)`      | expects that `x` is equal to `y`        |
| `expect_equivalent(x, y)` | expects that `x` is equivalent to `y`   |
| `expect_identical(x, y)`  | expects that `x` is identical to `y`    |
| `expect_lt(x, y)`         | expects that `x` is less than `y`       |
| `expect_gt(x, y)`         | expects that `x` is greater than `y`    |
| `expect_lte(x, y)`        | expects that `x` is less than or equal to `y` |
| `expect_gte(x, y)`        | expects that `x` is greater than or equal `y` |
| `expect_named(x)`         | expects that `x` has names `y`          |
| `expect_matches(x, y)`    | expects that `x` matches `y` (regex)    |
| `expect_message(x, y)`    | expects that `x` gives message `y`      |
| `expect_warning(x, y)`    | expects that `x` gives warning `y`      |
| `expect_error(x, y)`      | expects that `x` throws error `y`       |

## Part 2) Practice writing simple tests

- To start the practice, create a new directory, e.g. `lab09`
- `cd` to `lab09`
- Create an `R` script to write and document your functions: e.g. `functions.R`
- Create a separate `R` script `tests.R` to write the tests of your functions.
- Below is the filestructure for this part of the lab assignment

```
  lab09/
    functions.R
    tests.R
```


### Example with `stat_range()`

Let's start with a basic function `stat_range()` to compute the overall range
of a numeric vector. Create this function in the file `functions.R`.

```{r}
#' @title Range
#' @description computes the range of a numeric vector (i.e. max - min)
#' @param x a numeric vector
#' @return the range value (max - min)
stat_range <- function(x) {
  max(x) - min(x)
}
```



### Tests for `stat_range()`

To write the unit tests in `tests.R`, we are going to consider the following 
testing vectors:

- `x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`
- `y <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, NA)`
- `z <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)`
- `w <- letters[1:5]`

The typical structure of the tests has the following form:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# load the source code of the functions to be tested
source("functions.R")

# context with one test that groups expectations
context("Test for range value") 

test_that("range works as expected", {
  x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  
  expect_equal(stat_range(x), 4)
  expect_length(stat_range(x), 1)
  expect_type(stat_range(x), 'double')
})
```

- use `context()` to describe what the test are about
- use `test_that()` to group expectations:
    + output equal to 4
    + output of length one
    + output of type `double`
- to run the tests from the R console, use the function `test_file()` by passing
the path of the file `tests.R`

```{r eval = FALSE}
# assuming that your working directory is "lab09/"
library(testthat)
test_file("tests.R")
```

You could actually include a code chunk in your Rmd with the code above.


### Your Turn

Write more groups of tests---`test_that()`---to test `stat_range()` with the
rest of the testing vectors `y`, `z`, `w`:

- Using `y`, write expectations for:
    + output is of length one
    + output is equal to `NA_real_`
- Using `z`, write expectations for:
    + output is of length one
    + output is of type `integer`
    + output is equal to `1L`
- Using `w`, write expectations for:
    + throws an error


Try writing the following functions and come up with unit tests:

- `stat_centers()`
    - _title:_ measures of center
    - _description:_ computes measures of center such as Median and Mean
    - _param:_ a numeric vector
    - _return:_ a numeric vector with median and mean
    - use `mean()` and `median()` to write `stat_centers()`

- `stat_spreads()`
    - _title:_ measures of spread
    - _description:_ computes measures of spread such as Range, IQR, Standard Deviation
    - _param:_ a numeric vector
    - _return:_ a numeric vector with range, iqr, and stdev
    - use `stat_range()`, `IQR()`, and `sd()` to write `stat_spreads()`
